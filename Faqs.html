        <div class="content">
            <p>Here we've answered the questions we often get from prospective sponsors. If you have a question not covered here, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us through our contact form.</p>

            <h3>What is a podcast?</h3>
            <p>A podcast is a pre-recorded, on-demand audio file distributed over the Internet through a channel called an RSS feed. Podcasting technology has come a long way - most listeners today access their podcasts through a variety of smartphone apps, and the only thing you need to start listening is an Internet-connected device. We give a more detailed background of podcasts as a medium on our blog here. We also describe the most popular types of podcasts here.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What is a podcast ad?</h3>
            <p>A podcast ad is an ad spot that runs between 10 and 90 seconds. It can come in at the start of the episode (a pre-roll), during the episode (a mid-roll), or at the end of the episode (a post-roll). We dicuss the different types of ads in depth here</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What will the ad sound like?</h3>
            <p>The majority of podcast ads are host-read and will either consist of the podcast host reading from an ad script or giving an ad-libbed personal recommendation.

                You can listen to a few examples of recent Backyard Media podcast ads here. We also talk about why most podcast ads are host-read in a blog post here.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What do I need to provide Backyard Media for the ad?</h3>
            <p>Generally, an ad campaign will require either an ad script for the host or directions regarding what selling points the host should cover. Most campaigns will also need a promotional code or website URL from the sponsor that will be referenced during the ad. But don't worry, we'll be sure to walk you through the whole process, start to finish.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How can I make sure my ad sounds great?</h3>
            <p>We will work with all new sponsors to make sure their ad's content is maximally effective for a podcast listening audience. We have outlined a few helpful steps that sponsors can take to improve their ads here.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How does pricing work?</h3>
            <p>Podcast ad prices are priced in CPM (cost per thousand impressions). A podcast's CPM is based on a podcast's reported listener downloads, and the exact price can vary depending on a variety of factors, including the podcast's popularity, the ad's placement, and whether the podcast serves a specialized audience.</p>
            <p>We share our podcasts' CPMs with prospective sponsors before any ad purchase. For more about podcast CPMs, contact us or take a look at our pricing example here.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How often should my ad run?</h3>
            <p>Research shows that podcast ads are most effective when they run for multiple podcast episodes (with five or more ads being the most effective frequency). For more information about podcast ad campaigns, contact us or see our blog post about campaigns here.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Who listens to podcasts?</h3>
            <p>Lots of people! In 2017, a full 42 million Americans reported having listened to a podcast in the last week, a 100% increase from 2014.</p>
            <p>Podcast listeners are an ideal group of consumers. They're well-educated - 51% of them have a college degree, compared to just 36% of the general population. They also have above-average incomes, with a median annual income of $63,000 and 15% of listeners making over $150,000. Research also shows that listeners are intellectually curious, with high rates of media consumption. </p>
            <p>When compared with other digital media audiences, podcast listeners are uniquely loyal and engaged, as measured by their podcast listening habits and responsiveness to podcast ads. </p>
            <p>We've covered in our blog the habits of podcast listeners, the habits of podcast evangelists known as "super" listeners, and some of our podcast hosts' experiences with their listeners.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How do I know the ad will work?</h3>
            <p>There's lots of research showing that podcasts are the most cost-effective digital marketing tool out there. 61% of podcast listeners report they've purchased a product after hearing an ad, and podcast ads on average lead to a 55% increase in unaided brand awareness. A sponsor can immediately see the ROI of their podcast ads because most ads include trackable codes provided to listeners - we talk more about these "direct response" ads in a blog post here.</p>
            <p>For more research regarding the effectiveness of podcast ads, take a look at some of our analysis here. You can also check out our Resources page for more studies looking at podcasting and podcast ads.</p>
